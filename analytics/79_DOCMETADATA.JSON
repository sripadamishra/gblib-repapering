The acceptance of a late payment premium shall not constitute a waiver of \nany Default or Event of Default then existing or thereafter arising.

In the event that Borrower breaches its obligation \nto enter into and maintain an Interest Rate Protection Agreement in full force and effect as set forth \nin Section 2.6(a) hereof, in addition to Agent’s rights and remedies hereunder or under the other Loan \nDocuments, Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, at Borrower’s sole cost and expense and on Borrower’s \nbehalf, enter into an Interest Rate Protection Agreement as may be required pursuant to Section 2.6(a) hereof. In \nthe event that Agent shall elect to enter into an Interest Rate Protection Agreement on Borrower’s behalf, such \nInterest Rate Protection Agreement, at Agent’s election, may be a Lender Interest Rate Protection Agreement. In \nthe event that Borrower breaches its obligations to enter into or maintain an Interest Rate Protection Agreement \nin full force and effect as set forth in Section 2.6(a) hereof and during the continuance of such breach, Agent is \nhereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorney of Borrower (coupled with an interest), in its name \nand stead, to execute such an Interest Rate Protection Agreement and all necessary documents ancillary thereto, \nand for that purpose Agent may execute all necessary agreements and instruments, and may substitute one or \nmore persons with like power, Borrower hereby ratifying and confirming all that its said attorney or such \nsubstitute or substitutes shall lawfully do by virtue hereof.

Borrower shall not terminate, \nmodify, cancel or surrender, or permit the termination, modification, cancellation or surrender of, any Interest \nRate Protection Agreement without the prior consent of the Requisite Lenders. Within ten (10) Business Days \nafter Borrower obtains knowledge of or receipt of notice (which may be given by Agent or a Lender) of a \ndefault by the financial institution that is a party to any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, Borrower shall \nsubstitute for such defaulted Interest Rate Protection Agreement another Interest Rate Protection Agreement (to \nwhich the Person that defaulted under the defaulted Interest Rate Protection Agreement is not a party) so that, \nafter giving effect to such substitution, Borrower is in compliance with the requirements \nof Section 2.6(a) hereof. \n  \n33 \n \n(e) Receipts from Interest Rate Protection Agreements.

If an Event of Default occurs, Agent may, in its sole discretion, for so long as such Event \nof Default is continuing and in addition to any other rights and remedies hereunder, apply the amounts so held \nby Agent to the Loan or other amounts due under the Loan Documents at Agent’s election. Until such time as all \nObligations have been paid in full, Borrower shall have no right to withdraw or otherwise apply any funds \nreceived by Agent on account of any Interest Rate Protection Agreement. Such funds shall constitute additional ","security for the Obligations, a security interest therein being granted hereby. In the event Borrower receives any \nsums pursuant to or in connection with any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, it shall immediately pay such \nsums to Agent. \n(f) Security. No Interest Rate Protection Agreement shall be secured by all or any portion of the \nCollateral unless it is a Lender Interest Rate Protection Agreement, in which case such Lender Interest Rate \nProtection Agreement shall be secured pari passu with the other sums secured by the Mortgage and other \nSecurity Documents. \nSECTION 2.7. Intentionally Omitted. \nSECTION 2.8. Additional Interest. Borrower shall pay to Agent the following losses, costs and \nexpenses of Agent or any Lender incurred or reasonably estimated by Agent or such Lender, as applicable, to be \nincurred: \n(a) All “breakage” charges, i.e., losses, costs and expenses (including internal charges but excluding \nconsequential damages and excluding lost LIBOR Rate Margin) incurred by reason of obtaining, liquidating or \nredeploying deposits or other funds acquired by Agent or such Lender to fund or maintain the Loan as a result of \nany prepayment of the Loan or any delay or failure to prepay the Loan when required hereunder or otherwise; \nand \n(b) Any sums becoming payable by Borrower pursuant to any Lender Interest Rate Protection \nAgreement, including any termination thereof. \nIn any of the foregoing events, Borrower shall pay to Agent, (i) as to amounts due under clause (a) above, \nconcurrently with the principal payment, in the case of such breakage charges in connection with a payment of \nprincipal, and within ten (10) Business Days after written demand in all other cases or (ii) in the case of any \nLender Interest Rate Protection Agreement, within ten (10) Business Days or such shorter period as shall be \nspecified therein after written demand, such amount as shall equal the amount of the Additional Interest certified \nby Agent (or the applicable Lender) to Borrower by reason of such event. A certificate as to the amount of such \nAdditional Interest submitted by Agent to Borrower setting forth Agent’s (or the applicable \n  \n34 \n \nLender’s) basis for the determination of Additional Interest shall be conclusive evidence of the amount thereof, \nabsent manifest error. Failure on the part of Agent to demand payment from Borrower for any Additional \nInterest attributable to any particular period shall not constitute a waiver of Agent’s (or the applicable Lender’s) \nright to demand payment of such amount for any subsequent or prior period. \nSECTION 2.9. No Withholdings. All sums payable by Borrower under the Note, this Loan \nAgreement and the other Loan Documents, shall be paid in full and without set-off or counterclaims and free of \nany deductions or withholdings for any and all present and future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, duties, \nfiling and other fees or charges, excluding Excluded Taxes (collectively, “Taxes”). In the event that Borrower is \nprohibited by any law from making any such payment free of such deductions or withholdings with respect to \nTaxes, then Borrower shall pay such additional amount to Agent as may be necessary in order that the actual \namount received by Lenders after such deduction or withholding (and after payment of any additional Taxes due \nas a consequence of the payment of such additional amount) shall equal the amount that would have been \nreceived if such deduction or withholding were not required; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be \nobligated to pay such additional amount on account of a specific Lender if at the time such Lender became a \n“Lender” hereunder, Borrower is required to deduct or withhold any sums solely because such Lender had a \nlegal basis to deliver, but failed to deliver, to Borrower a duly executed copy of United States Internal Revenue \nService Form W-8 BEN, W-8 ECI, W-9 or other form or statement prescribed by law from time to time and \napplicable to a Lender (in such number of copies as may be prescribed by law from time to time), and any \nrequired renewal thereof, as the case may be, which, pursuant to the applicable provisions of an income tax \ntreaty between the United States and the country of residence of the Lender, the IRC, or any applicable rule or \nregulation under the IRC, indicate that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under the Loan Documents \nwithout deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, or at a tax rate that is reduced to \nzero (or, upon written request of Borrower specifying the applicable form which such Lender may in accordance \nwith law sign with no disadvantageous consequences to it or any of its affiliates as determined by such Lender, \nat a reduced rate of tax or deduction), and as result of such failure, Borrower was prohibited by the IRC from \nmaking any such payment free (or at a reduced rate as aforesaid) of such deductions or withholding. \nNotwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.9, in no event will any Lender’s failure to deliver any such ","forms, or any renewal or extension thereof, affect, postpone or relieve Borrower from any obligation to pay \nInterest, principal, Additional Interest and other amounts due under the Loan Documents (other than as \nexpressly set forth above in this Section 2.9). Such additional amount shall be due concurrently with the \npayment with respect to which such additional amount is owed in the amount of Taxes certified by Agent (or the \napplicable Lender). A certificate as to the amount of Taxes submitted by Agent to Borrower setting forth \nAgent’s (or the applicable Lender’s ) basis for the determination of Taxes shall be conclusive evidence of the \namount thereof, absent manifest error. Failure on the part of Agent to demand payment from Borrower for any \nTaxes attributable to any particular period shall not constitute a waiver of Agent’s (or the applicable Lender’s) \nright to demand payment of such amount for any subsequent or prior period. In the event that Borrower is \nobligated to pay any additional amounts described in this Section 2.9 in respect of the Loan, the applicable \nLender shall, at no cost to such Lender, make commercially reasonable efforts to designate another of its lending \noffices to be the Applicable Lending Office of such Lender if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, doing \nso would avoid or materially reduce \n  \n35 \n \nsuch additional amounts payable by Borrower and would not be disadvantageous to such Lender. Nothing in the \nimmediately foregoing sentence shall postpone Borrower’s obligation to pay such additional amounts as and \nwhen they become payable hereunder. \nSECTION 2.10. Unavailability of LIBOR; Illegality. \n(a) Unavailability of LIBOR. If on any date on which Borrower seeks to establish a LIBOR Rate \nas the Applicable Interest Rate pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof or if Section 2.3(d) hereof applies, Agent \ndetermines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent manifest error) that \n(i) Dollar deposits in an amount approximately equal to the then outstanding principal balance of the Loan \nPortion bearing interest at a LIBOR Rate are not generally available at such time in the London interbank \nEurodollar market for deposits in Eurodollars, (ii) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR, or \n(iii) the Applicable Interest Rate would be in excess of the maximum interest rate which Borrower may by law \npay, Agent shall promptly give notice (the “Non-Availability Notice”) of such fact to Borrower and the option \nto convert to or to continue the Applicable Interest Rate on such Loan Portion as a LIBOR Rate shall be \nsuspended until such time as such condition no longer exists. In the event that the option to elect, to convert to \nor to continue an Applicable Interest Rate as a LIBOR Rate shall be suspended as provided in \nthis Section 2.10(a), effective upon the giving of the Non-Availability Notice, and if applicable, effective as of \nthe first date that the one (1) month LIBOR Rate Period would otherwise be in effect pursuant \nto Section 2.3(d) hereof, interest on the Loan Portion for which a LIBOR Rate was to be determined shall be \npayable at the Base Rate, from and including the date of the giving of the Non-Availability Notice (or the date \nthat the one (1) month LIBOR Rate Period would otherwise be in effect pursuant to Section 2.3(d) hereof, if \napplicable) until the Maturity Date or until any earlier date on which a LIBOR Rate shall become effective for \nsuch Loan Portion pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof following the giving of notice by Agent to Borrower that the \nconditions referred to in this Section 2.10(a) no longer exist (Agent agreeing to give prompt notice to Borrower \nif such conditions no longer exist). \n(b) Illegality. In the event that at any time while any Loan Portion bears interest at a LIBOR Rate, \nany Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower) that it shall become \nillegal for such Lender to maintain the Loan or a portion thereof on the basis of one or more LIBOR Rates, \nAgent shall promptly after receiving notice thereof from such Lender give notice of such fact to Borrower, and \nthe option to elect, to convert to or to continue the Applicable Interest Rate on any Loan Portion as a LIBOR \nRate shall be suspended until such time as such condition shall no longer exist (Agent agreeing to give prompt \nnotice to Borrower if such conditions no longer exist). In the case of existing Loan Portions affected by the \ncircumstances described in the immediately preceding sentence, the Applicable Interest Rate on such Loan \nPortion shall be converted automatically to the Base Rate (unless such Lender determines that such conversion \nis not required with respect to any existing Loan Portion) and shall be payable at the Base Rate in the same \nmanner as provided in Section 2.10(a) hereof. \n  \n36 \n \nSECTION 2.11. Increased Costs and Capital Adequacy. \n(a) Borrower agrees to pay Agent additional amounts (without duplication of any other amounts \npayable in respect of increased costs pursuant to this Loan Agreement) as Agent shall reasonably determine will ","compensate Lenders for additional costs incurred in maintaining the Loan or any portion thereof outstanding or \nfor the reduction of any amounts received or receivable as a result of any change after the date hereof in any \napplicable law, regulation or treaty, or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any domestic or foreign \ngovernmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the \nforce of law), or by any domestic or foreign court, (i) changing the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender \n(other than taxes imposed on all or any portion of the overall net income of any Lender by the United States or \nby any political subdivision or taxing authority of the United States), (ii) imposing, modifying or applying any \nreserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, credit \nextended by, or any other acquisition of funds for loans by any Lender (whether directly, indirectly or on a \nportfolio wide basis) or (iii) imposing on any Lender any other condition affecting the Note or the Loan. \n(b) If any Lender shall determine in good faith that (i) any change enacted after the date hereof in \nthe application of any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted or arising out of the July 1988 report of the \nBasel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled “International Convergence of \nCapital Measurement and Capital Standards,” including the draft Capital Accord proposed to replace such \nreport, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any domestic or foreign governmental \nauthority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, (ii) any \nchange in or adoption of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy enacted after the \ndate hereof, or (iii) compliance by any Lender, or any lending office of any Lender, or the holding company of \nany Lender, with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of \nany such authority, central bank or comparable agency based on any such change or adoption, has or would \nhave the effect of reducing the rate of return on any Lender’s capital to a level below that which such Lender \nwould have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such \nLender with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower shall pay to Agent such additional \namounts (without duplication of any other amounts payable pursuant to this Loan Agreement) as will \ncompensate Lenders for such actual reduction with respect to any portion of the Loan outstanding. \n(c) Any amount payable by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or (b) hereof shall be paid to \nAgent within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Borrower of a certificate of Agent setting forth the applicable \nlaw, change or other matter giving rise to such amount as described herein, the amount due, and Agent’s basis \nfor the determination of such amount, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent \nmanifest error. Failure on the part of Agent to demand payment from Borrower for any such amount attributable \nto any particular period shall not constitute a waiver of Agent’s right to demand payment of such amount for any \nsubsequent or prior period. \n(d) Notwithstanding Sections 2.11(a) and (b) hereof, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines or directions \nunder or in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n  \n37 \n \nConsumer Protection Act shall be deemed not to have been the subject of any request or directive implemented \nor any change having occurred prior to the date hereof and (ii) any change based on the reports and supporting \ndocumentation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of December 2009 entitled “Strengthening the \nResilience of the Banking Sector” and “International Framework for Liquidity Risk Measurement, Standards \nand Monitoring”, in each case together with any amendments thereto, shall not be deemed to have occurred on \nor prior to the Closing Date. \nSECTION 2.12. Usury. The Note, this Loan Agreement, the Mortgage, and the other Loan \nDocuments are subject to the express condition that at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay \ninterest on the Obligations at a rate which could subject any Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a result \nof being in excess of the maximum interest rate which Borrower is permitted by law to contract for or to agree \nto pay. If by the terms of the Note, this Loan Agreement, the Mortgage or any other Loan Document, Borrower \nis at any time required or obligated to pay interest at a rate in excess of such maximum rate, the rate of interest \nshall be deemed to be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and, to the extent not prohibited by law, the \ninterest payments in excess of such maximum rate and shall be applied and shall be deemed to have been \npayments in reduction of principal. \nSECTION 2.13. Closing. The Closing shall be held pursuant to an escrow with the Title Company. \nSECTION 2.14. Loan Fee Letter. Borrower shall pay to Agent the fees provided for in the Loan \nFee Letter in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement and the Loan Fee Letter. ","SECTION 2.15. Cash Sweep Provisions. On the third (3rd) Payment Date following any Testing \nDetermination Date as of which a Cash Sweep Condition is determined or deemed to exist, and thereafter on \neach of the two (2) immediately succeeding Payment Dates, in addition to all other amounts then due and \nowing, Borrower shall (i) deposit into the Cash Sweep Account an amount (the “Applicable Excess Amount”) \nequal to the lesser of (A) all Excess Cash Flow with respect to the calendar month ending immediately prior to \nthe calendar month immediately prior to such applicable Payment Date, as adjusted for seasonal variations in a \nmanner and amount reasonably agreed upon by Borrower and Agent, and (B) the Cash Sweep Limit and \n(ii) deliver to Agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail Borrower’s calculation of Excess Cash Flow \nand the Applicable Excess Amount; provided, however, that in any event, Borrower shall in addition make a \ndeposit into the Cash Sweep Account on the first two (2) Payment Dates following the Closing Date, in each \nth\ncase in an amount as determined pursuant to the preceding clause (A). On the fifth (5 ) Payment Date following \neach Testing Determination Date as of which a Cash Sweep Condition is determined or deemed to exist (but \nsubject to the last sentence of this Section 2.15), all amounts on deposit in the Cash Sweep Account shall be \napplied by Agent to the reduction of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan or, if Agent permits in its sole \ndiscretion, be disbursed by Agent to pay or reimburse Borrower for operating shortfalls of the Premises for any \nth\nmonth during the period from the applicable Testing Determination Date to such fifth (5 ) following Payment \nDate. Concurrently with any such application to principal, Borrower shall pay to Agent all sums required to be \npaid pursuant to, and shall otherwise comply with, Section 2.4(f) hereof, but no Spread Maintenance \n  \n38 \n \nFee shall be applicable. In illustration of the foregoing, in the event that the Testing Determination Date with \nrespect to which a Cash Sweep Condition exists would be March 31, (x) the third (3rd) Payment Date following \nsuch Testing Determination Date would be the first (1st) Business Day of June and the applicable calendar \nmonth for which Applicable Excess Amount would be deposited on such Payment Date would be April, (y) the \nfirst immediately succeeding Payment Date thereafter would be the first (1st) Business Day of July and the \napplicable calendar month for which Applicable Excess Amount would be deposited on such Payment Date \nwould be May, and (z) the second immediately succeeding Payment Date thereafter would be the first \n(1st) Business Day of August and the applicable calendar month for which Applicable Excess Amount would be \nst\ndeposited on such Payment Date would be June (and on the first (1 ) Business Day of August, all funds in the \nCash Sweep Account, including those deposited on that date, will be applied to principal (or disbursed to pay or \nreimburse operating shortfalls) as aforesaid); provided, that, the Applicable Excess Amounts to be deposited on \nthe Payment Dates occurring on the first (1st) Business Day of June, July and August would be deposited even \nif no Cash Sweep Condition exists as of the June 30th Testing Determination Date; provided, further, that, in the \nevent that a Cash Sweep Condition exists as of the June 30th Testing Determination Date, Borrower shall \ncontinue to deposit the Applicable Excess Amounts with respect to the applicable calendar months of July, \nAugust and September on the Payment Dates occurring on the first (1st) Business Day of each of September, \nOctober and November, respectively. Disbursements from the Cash Sweep Account to reimburse Borrower for \noperating shortfalls as provided above shall be conditioned on, among other things, the absence of any First Tier \nDefault or Event of Default and Agent’s receipt of a request for disbursement, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to Agent, accompanied by such supporting documentation as Agent shall require. Promptly \nfollowing termination of a Cash Sweep Condition, provided there exists no Event of Default, Agent shall remit \nto Borrower all sums in the Cash Sweep Account. \nSECTION 2.16. FF&E Reserve Account. \n(a) On the Closing Date, Borrower shall cause to be deposited all sums in its pre-existing capital \nreserve or similar account (if any) into an interest-bearing account or sub-account at Agent (the “FF&E Reserve \nAccount”). Thereafter, on each Payment Date, and in addition to all other amounts then due and owing, \nBorrower shall (i) deposit into the FF&E Reserve Account, in cash or other immediately available funds, the \nFF&E Reserve Amount for the second (2nd) calendar month immediately prior to such Payment Date (e.g., the \npayment due on March 1, shall be the FF&E Reserve Amount for the preceding January) and (ii) deliver to \nAgent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail Borrower’s calculation of such FF&E Reserve Amount. \nInterest on the FF&E Reserve Account shall be deposited therein and become part of the funds therein. \n(b) From time to time, but no more frequently than once per calendar month, Borrower may submit \nto Agent a FF&E Disbursement Request with respect to FF&E Expenditures and/or Capital Expenditures. So \nlong as the expenditures that are the subject of such FF&E Disbursement Request are Approved FF&E \nExpenditures or Approved Capital Expenditures, Agent shall disburse to Borrower from the available balance of \nthe FF&E Reserve Account an amount equal to the Approved FF&E Expenditures and/or Approved Capital ","Expenditures which were requested in such FF&E Disbursement Request. Additionally, in the event of an \nemergency or other unexpected event at the Premises that requires Borrower to make \n  \n39 \n \nan emergency Capital Expenditure or FF&E Expenditure in order to protect or secure the Premises, property \ncontained therein or the life and safety of Persons at the Premises, or in order to maintain the normal operation \nof the Premises, Borrower may request a disbursement from the FF&E Reserve Account to pay or reimburse \nBorrower for such expenditure to the extent of funds on deposit in the FF&E Reserve Account by submitting a \nFF&E Disbursement Request for same, together with an explanation of the emergency or event, the proposed \nCapital Expenditure or FF&E Expenditure and such other information Agent reasonably \nrequests; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not include emergencies or other unexpected events that \nare, or arise from, a Casualty or other insured event (or event that would have been insured if the Insurance \nPolicies were in effect) or a Taking. Borrower shall use disbursements from the FF&E Reserve Account solely \nfor the purpose of paying those amounts specified in each FF&E Disbursement Request or reimbursing \nBorrower for such amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of \nan Event of Default, Agent shall have no obligation to make any disbursement from the FF&E Reserve Account. \nAgent’s concurrence with any FF&E Disbursement Request shall not be deemed to constitute a representation \nthat no Default or Event of Default has occurred and/or is continuing or a waiver of any Default or Event of \nDefault or any right or remedy resulting therefrom. \n(c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent may apply any \nfunds on deposit in the FF&E Reserve Account as set forth in Section 8.5 hereof and shall have all other rights \nand remedies with respect to the FF&E Reserve Account specified in this Loan Agreement and in any other \nLoan Document, at law and in equity. \nSECTION 2.17. Collection and Operating Accounts. \n(a) Borrower shall cause all Gross Revenue and all other profits, issues, accounts, accounts \nreceivable, income, receipts and revenues of Borrower to be paid and deposited directly into the Collection \nAccount. If Borrower actually receives any of the foregoing, Borrower shall cause same to be deposited into the \nCollection Account within two (2) Business Days after receipt. Borrower shall deliver to Agent an Account \nAgreement with respect to the Collection Account, executed by Borrower and, if applicable, Property Manager, \nand the depository at which the Collection Account is held if not at Agent. Borrower shall also deliver to Agent \na Credit Card Servicer Agreement from each credit card company, servicer or agency used by Borrower and/or \nProperty Manager, executed by Borrower and/or Property Manager, as applicable, and such credit card \ncompany, servicer or agency promptly after engaging same. \n(b) Borrower shall not, and shall not permit Property Manager to, close the Collection Account or \nopen any additional Collection Account without the prior consent of Agent. Within three (3) Business Days after \nnotice from Agent at any time upon the occurrence and during the continuance of or after the occurrence of an \nEvent of Default, Borrower shall cause the Collection Account to be held at Agent or another depository bank \nsatisfactory to Agent in its sole discretion. \n(c) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and Agent shall not have \nnotified Borrower pursuant to Section 8.5 hereof that Borrower’s right to receive funds from the Collection \nAccount is terminated, funds shall be swept from the \n  \n40 \n \nCollection Account to the Operating Account. Property Manager may from time to time make withdrawals from \nthe Operating Account (i) to pay reasonable or necessary expenses incurred by Borrower or Property Manager \n(without duplication) in the ownership, maintenance, use, operation and leasing of the Premises as shown in the \nthen-applicable annual operating budget for the Premises, (ii) to pay Debt Service and other sums in respect of \nthe Obligations, (iii) to pay for alterations and other Capital Expenditures and FF&E and (iv) to make \ndistributions to or to pay or repay loans from Borrower’s members and for any other purposes of Borrower, \nsubject, however, to any limitations and prohibitions on withdrawals and use of funds set forth in this Loan \nAgreement and the other Loan Documents. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of \nDefault and notice from Agent as aforesaid, Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any other Person to, receive \nfunds from the Collection Account except as may be approved by Agent in writing. To the extent any funds \nwere withdrawn by or on behalf of Borrower or Property Manager from the Collection Account after the ","occurrence of an Event of Default and notice from Agent as aforesaid, Borrower shall cause the withdrawn \nfunds to be redeposited in the Collection Account. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event \nof Default, Agent may apply any funds on deposit in the Collection Account as set forth in Section 8.5 hereof \nand shall have all other rights and remedies with respect to the Collection Account specified in this Loan \nAgreement and in any other Loan Document, at law and in equity. \n(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Borrower shall not, and shall not permit \nProperty Manager to, make any withdrawals from the Operating Account or use any Gross Revenues or other \nprofits, issues, accounts, accounts receivable, income, receipts, revenues or security deposits in contravention of \nthis Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document. Borrower shall cause each and every withdrawal from the \nOperating Account by Borrower and Property Manager to be used for the purpose for which such withdrawal \nwas made and for no other purpose. \nSECTION 2.18. Tenant Security Account. \n(a) Borrower shall comply with all Legal Requirements and the applicable Lease applicable to any \nsecurity given under any Lease. Subject to the foregoing, Borrower shall deposit or cause to be deposited all \nSecurity Deposits under the Major Leases into an account with a bank or other financial institution approved by \nAgent (the “Tenant Security Account”) within two (2) Business Days after receipt. \n(b) Borrower may make withdrawals from the Tenant Security Account at such time as no Event of \nDefault has occurred and is continuing provided the proceeds are (i) applied in the ordinary course of business \nto sums due under the applicable Lease when the terms of such Lease or applicable Legal Requirements permit \nthe application thereof or (ii) returned to the applicable Lessee pursuant to Legal Requirements or the terms of \nthe applicable Lease which require Borrower to return such other Security Deposit. After the occurrence and \nduring the continuation of an Event of Default, neither Borrower nor any other Person shall have any right to, \nand Borrower covenants that it shall not, and shall not permit Property Manager to, withdraw any amounts from \nthe Tenant Security Account or apply any Security Deposits, except as may be approved by Agent. However, if \nan Event of Default exists but Borrower is required pursuant to the terms of the applicable Lease or applicable \nLegal \n  \n41 \n \nRequirements to return any Security Deposit to the applicable Lessee, Borrower shall deliver a notice to Agent \ncertifying same and stating the reason therefor, and Agent shall, at Agent’s option and at Borrower’s sole cost \nand expense, either permit Borrower to return the Security Deposit to the applicable Lessee or, if Agent elects, \ncause such Security Deposit to be returned directly to the applicable Lessee. Upon the occurrence and during the \ncontinuance of an Event of Default, Agent may apply any funds on deposit in the Tenant Security Account as \nset forth in Section 8.5 hereof and shall have all other rights and remedies with respect to the Tenant Security \nAccount specified in this Loan Agreement and in any other Loan Document, at law and in equity, subject to the \nrights of the Lessees under Major Leases in their Security Deposits. Upon payment in full of the Obligations, \nand at Borrower’s sole cost and expense, Agent shall return any Security Deposits held by it to Borrower. \n(c) Borrower shall transfer to the name of Agent and deliver to Agent all original Lease Letters of \nCredit under each Major Lease promptly after receipt of same, together with evidence that all fees payable to the \nissuer on account of such assignment and transfer have been paid. All such Lease Letters of Credit shall be \ntransferable by their terms. Borrower hereby grants to Agent and Lenders a security interest in all rights of \nBorrower in and to all Lease Letters of Credit, including all proceeds thereof, as additional security for the \nObligations. In addition to all other rights and remedies of Agent and Lenders, Agent may, and to the extent \nnecessary in order to do so, Borrower hereby grants to Agent, effective from the occurrence and during the \ncontinuance of an Event of Default, an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an interest, and Agent shall \nbe entitled to act pursuant to such power following an Event of Default that shall have occurred and be \ncontinuing by reason of a failure to comply with the terms of this Section 2.18(c), solely to draw upon or \notherwise realize on each such Lease Letters of Credit in accordance with its terms and those of the applicable \nLease. \n(d) Borrower shall hold and apply all Lease Letters of Credit and the proceeds thereof subject to the \nsame terms and conditions as Security Deposits pursuant to Section 2.18(a) and (b) hereof. Additionally, \nBorrower may draw on any Lease Letter of Credit in its possession if the issuer has elected to cancel or not \nrenew such Lease Letter of Credit, provided that the proceeds thereof are held as a Security Deposit in \naccordance with Section 2.18(a) and (b) hereof. If Borrower delivered a Lease Letter of Credit to Agent, and \n(i) Borrower is entitled to make a drawing on such Lease Letter of Credit under the terms of the applicable ","Lease, such Lease Letter of Credit or applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) no Event of Default shall have \noccurred and be continuing, Agent shall, at Borrower’s sole cost and expense, re-transfer such Lease Letter of \nCredit to Borrower in trust for the benefit of Agent and subject to Agent’s security interest, provided that \nBorrower delivers to Agent a written request certifying compliance with the conditions set forth in the \nforegoing clauses (i) and (ii), and indicating the applicable Lease and Letter of Credit, the amount of the draw \nand the reasons for such draw. Borrower shall hold any such Lease Letter of Credit solely for the purpose of \ndrawing or realizing thereon in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Lease or Lease Letter of Credit \nand Legal Requirements and shall apply the proceeds thereof in the ordinary course of business to sums due \nunder the applicable Lease in conformance with the requirements of the terms thereof and applicable Legal \nRequirements. If such draw is to be made because the issuer has elected to cancel or not renew such Lease \nLetter of Credit, a copy of such notice of election to cancel or not renew shall also be delivered to Agent \ntogether with Borrower’s request. If any proceeds of such Lease Letter of Credit are paid to Agent instead of \nBorrower, Agent shall \n  \n42 \n \ntransfer same to Borrower provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing for application as \nprovided in Section 2.18(a) and (b) hereof. The original of any such Lease Letters of Credit (to the extent not \nfully drawn) shall be promptly re-assigned, transferred and re-delivered to Agent. Borrower shall promptly \ndeposit the proceeds of any such drawing into the Collection Account, unless the drawing is being made to \nliquidate any Lease Letter of Credit because the issuer thereof has elected to cancel or not to renew same or for \nany other reason not arising from a default by the Lessee, in which case Borrower shall deposit such proceeds in \nthe Tenant Security Account. If Borrower is required by the terms of the applicable Leases or applicable Legal \nRequirements to return any Lease Letter of Credit previously delivered to Agent to the Lessee, Agent shall, at \nBorrower’s sole cost and expense, re-assign and transfer and deliver possession of such original Lease Letter of \nCredit to Borrower provided Borrower delivers to Agent a written request for same, certifying the foregoing and \nindicating the applicable Lease and Letter of Credit and the reasons for such return. Borrower shall promptly \nreturn the same to the applicable Lessee. At Agent’s election and at Borrower’s sole cost and expense, instead of \ndelivering such Lease Letter of Credit to Borrower, Agent shall return same to the applicable Lessee. If a Lease \npermits a Lessee to re-post a new Lease Letter of Credit, or to amend an existing Lease Letter of Credit, Agent \nwill permit same and cooperate with Borrower to effect same, at Borrower’s sole cost and expense. Upon \npayment in full of the Obligations and at Borrower’s sole cost and expense, Agent shall return any Lease Letter \nof Credit held by it to Borrower. \nSECTION 2.19. Accounts. Borrower hereby grants to Agent a security interest in all rights of \nBorrower in and to the Accounts (other than the Operating Account) and all sums on deposit therein as \nadditional security for the Obligations. Borrower shall cause all banks or financial institutions other than Agent \nwhich are holding any Account (other than the Operating Account) to execute and deliver to Agent an Account \nAgreement with respect to such Account. Subject to the rights of Borrower expressly set forth herein to receive \nfunds and make and permit others to make withdrawals from the Accounts, Borrower hereby acknowledges and \nagrees that Agent shall have sole dominion and control of the Accounts (other than the Operating Account). \nBorrower shall not close any Account without obtaining the prior written consent of Agent. Borrower shall not \nopen any Account in substitution for or in addition to any Account set forth in Schedule 5.11 attached hereto \nwithout Agent’s prior consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Operating Account and the \nTenant Security Account, Borrower may open new Account(s) to serve as the Operating Account or the Tenant \nSecurity Account without Agent’s consent provided that (a) Borrower gives Agent at least ten (10) Business \nDays prior notice of Borrower’s intention to open a new Account, (b) the bank or other financial institution at \nwhich such Account is to be opened is reasonably acceptable to Agent and (c) with respect to the Tenant \nSecurity Account only, prior to the opening of such Account, Borrower shall have delivered to Agent an \nAccount Agreement with respect to such Account executed by it and Property Manager if applicable and such \nbank or other financial institution. Borrower shall maintain the Accounts and shall pay all fees and charges with \nrespect thereto when due, and shall keep in full force and effect the Account Agreement with respect thereto, if \napplicable, except any Account which is closed in accordance with this Section 2.19. All interest earned on \namounts deposited in any Account shall be re-deposited therein and become part thereof. No funds in any \nAccount (other than the Operating Account) not held by Agent may be commingled with any other funds of \nBorrower, Property Manager, any Affiliate of Borrower or Property Manager or any other Person or with any \nfunds contained in any other Account not held by \n  \n43 \n ","Agent. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent may apply any funds on \ndeposit in the Accounts (other than the Operating Account) as set forth in Section 8.5 hereof and shall have all \nother rights and remedies with respect to the Accounts specified in this Loan Agreement and in any other Loan \nDocument, at law and in equity. Neither Agent nor Lenders shall be liable for any loss of interest on or any \npenalty or charge assessed against the funds in, payable on, or credited to any Account as a result of the exercise \nby Agent of any of its rights, remedies or obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, except as \nmay arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or any Lender. Upon payment in full of the \nObligations, at Borrower’s sole cost and expense, (i) if any Account is subject to an Account Agreement, Agent \nshall deliver a notice of termination of its security interest to the financial institution that is the party to such \nAccount Agreement and (ii) if any Account is held at Agent, Agent shall release the funds on deposit therein to \nBorrower, free of the security interest provided for herein. \nSECTION 2.20.

If for any reason the Defaulting Lender fails to make timely payment of any amount \nrequired to be paid by such Defaulting Lender to or for the benefit of Agent or any other Lender hereunder, \nthen, in addition to other rights and remedies which Agent or such other Lender may have hereunder or \notherwise, Agent or any Lender shall be entitled, but not obligated (i) to advance funds on behalf of any \nDefaulting Lender, (ii) to collect interest from the Defaulting Lender at the Base Rate until the date on which the \npayment is made, (iii) to withhold or set off or in the case of a Lender, to cause Agent to withhold or setoff, and \nto apply to the payment of the defaulted amount and any related interest, any amounts to be paid to the \nDefaulting Lender under this Loan Agreement, (iv) to bring an action or suit against the Defaulting Lender in a \ncourt of competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted amount and any related interest and (v) to purchase the \nDefaulting Lender’s interest in the Loan in the manner set forth in this Section 10.14.

If more than \none Lender exercises such right, each such Lender which is not a Defaulting Lender shall have the right to \nacquire (in accordance with such acquiring Lender’s Pro Rata Share or upon agreement of the Lenders that \ndesire to so purchase the Defaulting Lender’s interest, any other proportion) the Defaulting Lender’s interest in \nthe Loan. Such right to purchase shall be exercised by written notice from the applicable Lender(s) electing to \nexercise such right to the Defaulting Lender (an “Exercise Notice”), copies of which shall also be sent \nconcurrently to each other Lender. The Exercise Notice shall specify (i) the purchase price for the interest of the \nDefaulting Lender, determined in accordance with Section 10.15 hereof and (ii) the date on which such purchase \nis to occur, which shall be any Business Day which is not less than fifteen (15) days after the date on which the \nExercise Notice is given, provided that if such Defaulting Lender shall have cured its default in full (including \nwith the payment of any interest and other amounts due in connection therewith) to the satisfaction of Agent \nwithin said fifteen (15) day period, then the Exercise Notice shall be of no further effect and the non-defaulting \nLender(s) shall no longer have a right to purchase such Defaulting Lender’s interest. Upon any such purchase of \na Defaulting Lender’s interest and as of the date of such purchase (the “Purchase Date”), the Defaulting \nLender’s interest in the Loan, and its rights hereunder as a Lender arising from and after the Purchase Date (but \nnot its rights and liabilities with respect thereto or under this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents \n  \n100 \n ","for obligations, indemnities and other matters arising or matters occurring before the Purchase Date) shall \nterminate on the Purchase Date, and the Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably \nrequested to surrender and transfer such interest. Without in any manner limiting the remedies of Agent or any \nother Lender, the obligation of a Defaulting Lender to sell and assign its interest in the Loan under \nthis Section 10.14 shall be specifically enforceable by Agent and/or any other Lender by an action brought in \nany court of competent jurisdiction for such purpose, it being acknowledged and agreed that, in light of the \ndisruption in the administration of the Loan and the other terms of the Loan Documents that a Defaulting Lender \nmay cause, damages and other remedies at law are not adequate. \nSECTION 10.15. Purchase Price; Payment for Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share. The \npurchase price for the interest of a Defaulting Lender in the Loan (the “Purchase Price”) shall be equal to the \nsum of all of the Defaulting Lender’s advances under the Loan Documents outstanding as of the Purchase Date, \nless the costs and expenses incurred by Agent and any non-defaulting Lender directly as a result of the \nDefaulting Lender’s default hereunder, including interest accrued on such unpaid amounts (at the Base Rate), \ncourt costs and including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and fees for accountants and other \nsimilar advisors (provided that such costs and expenses are paid by the Lenders acquiring the interest of such \nDefaulting Lender to Agent and the Lenders incurring same). \nSECTION 10.16. Election of Interest Rate; Distribution of Funds to Lenders. Agent shall \npromptly notify each Lender upon its receipt of notice from Borrower pursuant to Section 2.3(b) hereof electing \nto convert to an Applicable Interest Rate. All sums received by Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents on \naccount of principal, Interest or other sums payable to all Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, \nafter application, at Agent’s option, of such sums to any amounts due and payable to Agent from Borrower or \nLenders under any Loan Document, which are received by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be paid to \nLenders on the date of receipt; such sums received by Agent after 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be paid \nto Lenders on or before the next succeeding Business Day.
